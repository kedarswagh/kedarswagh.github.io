## Research
My research interests are in the development of higher-order discontinuous Gakerin (DG) methods and kinetic schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws with a primary focus on shock-capturing algorithms and entropy stability in such frameworks. I am also interested in developing genuinely multidimensional extensions for higher-order numerical methods for hyperbolic balance laws. Currently, I also experiment with augmenting DG solvers with machine learning techniques and the use of neural networks to approximate the solution of hyperbolic PDEs.
